Inner Class
================
If a class is created in another class is called as Inner class.
Inner class is also called as nested class
=> Inner Classes are called as helper classes
=> only available for outer class
=-> hidden from other classes only outer class can action it's functionality

Types of Inner Class
=========================
1> Non Static Inner CLass
	1.1 Regular Inner Class
	1.2 Method Local inner class
	1.3 Anonymous Inner class\
	
2>Static Inner class : A inner class with static keyword is known as static inner class




======================================================================
Class Loader => 

Class loaders are used to load .class file into JVM's memory
java program(.java) ==> Compile ==> .class file ====> Run ====> JVM ===>O/p

=> When we compile java program java compiler will convert Source code into byte codes
=> When we run java program, JVM will load byte code and it will convert into machine code
=> JVM will load .class file into it's memory
=>JVM will use class loader to load .class file into it's memory

In java we have three types of class loader -
1) Bootstrap Class loader
2) Extension class loader
3) Application class loader

Bootstrap class loader is responsible to load all pre-defined java classes available in JRE rt.jar file
Note=> rt.jar means Runtime jar file,

Extension class loader is responsible to load some java file available in jre=>lib=>ext folder

Application Class loader is used to load our user defined classes.

 Class Loader Hierarchy = First Application class loader will try to load if not able to it will go to extension if it will not be in extension too it will
 check in Bootstrap if not there will get ClassNotFoundError
