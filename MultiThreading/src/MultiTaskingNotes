Task : Work
Single Tasking: Performing only one task at a time is called Single Tasking
Multi Tasking:Performing multiple task at a time is called as Multi Tasking

Multi Tasking - we can achieve in 2 types:
1) Process Based Multitasking
   Ex: Window OS
   
2) Thread Based Multitasking
  Ex; To execute our program logic parellely
  -> our program can complete quickly
  
Java supports Multithreading
USe Cases:
1> Send SMS to all customer at a time
2> Send email/back statement to all customer at end of month

Note: The main aim of multithreading is to complete more work in les time

======================================================

-> For every java program execution JVM will create one thread by default that thread is called as main thread

Java Program to get main thread

Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
System.out.println(currentThread);
		

================================================
USER Defined Thread--

In java we can crete USerDefinedthread in two ways--
1> By Extending Thread class
2> By Implementing Runnable interface
