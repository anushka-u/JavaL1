Generics In Java
===================
-> Generics introduced in Java 1.5 version
=> Generics are used to achieve type safety
=> Using Generics we can write our class independent of data type

The below method is tightly coupled and taking integer as a parameter
public void m1()
{
	//logic
}

To overcome above issue we can use Generic in java

package in.generics;

public class GenericDemo<T> {
	T obj;
	
	//method independent of data type
	public void m1(T i)
	{
		System.out.println("I am generic method, You can send any type of argument to me "+ i);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		GenericDemo gd = new GenericDemo();
		gd.m1("hi"); //string
		gd.m1( 101); //integer
		gd.m1(12.43f); //float
	}

}


Generic can be used on class level, variable level, constructor level and method level.

Generic with Wild cards
===========================

Demo<? extends Number> 

 = above wild card represent Demo can take any class obj which is extending from Generic Class.
