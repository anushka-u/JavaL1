Referenced Data Types==>
----------------------------

Arrays: 
========

=>we can store group of values in single variable
int[] a = new int[5];

Limitations on Array==
1 - Size is fixed
2 - only homogeneous value can be stored

_____________________________________________________________________

Object Array ==>
To overcome the issue with array we go with Object Array, Where we can store multiple kind of object

Object[] a = new Object[100];
a[0] =new Student(1,"Raju"]
a[1] = new Employee(12,"Rani"]

=========================================================================
To overcome problems of Arrays Collection was introduced in Java
=> Collections are used to store group of objects/values
Collections are growable/dynamic
=> we can store any type of data in collections
=>Collection provides predefined method to do CRUD operations
=>used to store group of objects

Collections => Collections Framework

Framework means ready made software
=======================================================

ArrayList Constructor
===============================

ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
ArrayList al = new ArrayList(int_capacity);
ArrayList al  = new ArrayList(Collection c);

 Note: ArrayyList isn't good for inserting in middle operation
 
 ==================================================
 => Set based collection implements Map Concept <=
 
 
 TREESET
 /**
 Implementation of Set interface
		 * Tree set will maintain natural sorting order
		 * Binary tree
		 * null not allowed
		 * In Tree Set only homogeneous value is allowed
		 * The reason it doesn't contain heterogeneous order is because it maintains natural sorting order
		 * it does compare value with it's previous value to maintain sorted order
		 * if we will add a string and number then comparison will fail
		 */

		 Note: TreeSet should perform sorting so always it will compare new added object with old object. In order to 
		 Compare object should be of same type otherwise we will get ClassCastException
		 
		 
=============================================================================================

Difference in between Collection, Collections and Collection Framework
=>
Collections is a container to store group of objects
We have an interface with a name Collection (java.util)

Collections is a a lass available in java.util package
(providing ready made methods to perform operations

Collection interface  & collections class are part of collections framework. Along with these 2 classes
there are several other classes and interface in collections framework.
