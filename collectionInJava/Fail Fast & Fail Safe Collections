Fail Fast & Fail Safe Collections
========================================

Collections are divided into two types
Fail fast and fail safe collection

When collections is throwing error immediately when we modify co0llection object 
while traversing the collections are fail fast collection
Ex : ArrayList, LinkedList. Vector,HashSet, LinkedHAshSet etc
Fail Fast collections will throw concurrent modification exception when collection is modified


=> Fail safe collection will not throw error even if we modify collection data(add/remove)
Ex: CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap etc...

Que: whta is the difference between hash map and week hash map?
=> HashMap keys will have strong reference that means  they will maintain a reference hence they are
not eligible for garbage collector

=>WeakHashMap keys will have weak reference that means they are  eligible for Garbage Collection.
=>Garbage collector will dominate WeakHashMap.

WeakHashMap <Integer,String> whm = new WeakHashMap<>();
		whm.put(1, "hi");
		whm.put(2, "hello");
		whm.put(3, "byee");
		whm.put( 4, "Soya");
		
		System.out.println(whm);
